    <h1>To the Right</h1>
    <p>Although the rumbling is unsettling, you decide to keep exploring while not descending any further. The path on the right is perfect for this.</p>
    <p>The ceiling begins to get lower and lower until  you are practically crawling. Your back and chest both touch either sides of the cave. Your flashlight shows that you are not far from an opening.</p>
    <p>You struggle, but you eventually push yourself into the opening. You are excited, and the thought comes to mind that you are probably the first person to step here in all of history. The opening is narrow enough to touch either side with both arms at once, but tall enough that you can stand up.</p>
    <p>You celebrate breifly before making a horrifying realization.</p>
    <p>The rumbling you had heard earlier was not from some sort of creature or entity. It was <i>thunder.</i></p>
    <p>water starts pouring from the entrance to the opening. you don't think much of it at first, but once the water it up to the top of your boots, you realize you need to get out, now.</p>
    <p>you attempt to make your way back to where you came from, with little success. when you finally get your head and torso through the tight entrance to the opening, you find yourself stuck as the water rushes into your face. You gasp, trying to breath, but pockets of air in the rushing water are few and far between.</p>
    <p>You wish you would have just turned back.</p>
