    <h1>Deeper Down</h1>
    <p>You decide on taking the path to your left, which continues to drop deeper into the earth.</p>
    <p>You get excited as the walls begin to draw farther apart as you descend. Pretty soon, you can no longer touch both sides of the cave.</p>
    <p>testing how far apart the walls now are (and not being able to safely use your flashlight while hanging on the rope), you attempt to use the rope you hang on to swing back and forth. You are surprised to find that the cave wall behind you is closer than you though, and you bang your head on the stone.</p>
    <p>Instinctively, you grab your head where you hit the stone. You spend the final few seconds of your life wishing that you had held onto the rope, and that the cave floor would have been closer below you.</p>
    <p>Your head is impaled by a stalagmite and you die instantly.</p>
