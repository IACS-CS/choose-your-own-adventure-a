    <h1>Straight Down</h1>
    <p>Curious to see what lies at the deepest stretch of this cave, you decide to continue your descent.</p>
    <p>For most of your descent, you don't find anything notable. For the most part, it's all just the same cold, wet stone. Using your phone's flashlight, you find a few skeletons of small animals, who found themselves stuck in the steep cave with no visible way out.</p>
    <p>While observing what you believe to have been a squirrel at one point, the battery on your phone dies. It is then that you realize just how dark the cave is. Even holding your hand an inch in front of your face, you cannot see anything.</p>
    <p>You take this as your sign to make your way back, although it will be significantly more difficult when missing one of your senses. You try to push yourself up using the stone below you, but to your horror, there is no stone below you. Stumbling, you try to move your other limbs to find something to pull yourself up but you slide downwards, tripping on the rampant cave walls.</p>
    <p>You fall deeper into a wider section of the cave, and you hear a loud crack and feel a sharp pain in your arm. You've broken a bone.</p>
    <p>You let out a scream but nobody can hear you. the cave walls seem to amplify the sound and echo it only back to you.</p>
    <p>The last few minutes of your life are spent bleeding out at the bottom of a hole in the ground, wishing you had never even came across the cave to begin with.</p>
