    <h1>Gather Supplies</h1>
    <p>Excited yet still cautious to see the interior of the cave, you go home to gather supplies.</p>
    <ul><li>a long rope</li><li>a flashlight</li><li>boots</li><li>some more protective clothing</li></ul>
    <p>Although you don't have any professional spelunking crap around your house, you feel much safer when you return to the cave.</p>
    <p>You tie the rope around a tree that sits on top of the cave's mouth, dropping the other end down. You use it to safely descend deeper into the cave.</p>
    <p>Inside of the cave, The temperature drops. slowly, the hard stone ceiling of the cave becomes the walls as your descent becomes steeper and steeper.</p>
    <P>Your flashlight shows you that many animals have found themselves trapped in the cave, as you pass by many carcasses. Thankfully, they have all been already reduced to bone, and do not give off any odor. You think to yourself that maybe that could have ended up being yourself were you to not bring a rope.</P>
    <p>a short while later, you come across a fork in the cave. The path on the <a href="left.html">left</a> goes straight downwards, while the path on your <a href="right.html">right</a> seems short and less steep as you shine your flashlight down them.</p>
    <p>As you are about to choose a path, you hear a loud, low rumble that vibrates through the unforgiving stone around you. You don't know what it is, but you hope that it's not something that's in the cave with you. You consider turning <a href="back.html">back.</a></p>
