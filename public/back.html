    <h1>Turn Back</h1>
    <p>After hearing the rumbling sound, you decide that the safest route would be to find your way back. You begin climbing your way up, with the help of your rope.</p>
    <p>It takes a long time, but eventually you can see the light of the sky peaking through from the cave's mouth.</p>
    <p>You still wonder what the rumbling sound was, and what lies in the bottom of the cave, but are glad to have made it out alive.</p>
    <p>It is then when the entire planet explodes becase I think it would be funny if you die no matter what you do. The end,</p>
